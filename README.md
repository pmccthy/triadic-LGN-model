# Biophysically Detailed Network Model of the LGN with Triadic Synapses

This model of the triadic circuitry of the mouse LGN was developed at Imperial College London in 2019 under the supervision of Professor Simon Schultz. It was subsequently used to investigate temporal selectivity as a possible function of triadic synapses in the LGN. This work culminated in a conference paper which can be found here: https://doi.org/10.11159/icbes20.126
